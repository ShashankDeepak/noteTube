# NoteTube

NoteTube is an app that lets you take notes while watching YouTube videos. It has a unique design that displays the video on top of the screen and a text editor below it. You can save and search for your notes later, and the app also offers a text-processing AI powered by ChatGPT technology to provide additional help and insights. NoteTube is ideal for students, researchers, or anyone who wants to enhance their learning experience on YouTube.
